    "# SPE Gulf Coast Section ML Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "By Jeremy Zhao\n",
    "Date: February 25, 2021\n",
    "\n",
    "This is my second machine learning submission. This challenge was to take data provided by the SPE Gulf Coast group to predict the DTSM sonic log from well logs. The particular challenge in this was that there were very few opportunities to a leaderboard, and the fact that I am not well versed in well logs. \n",

    "This Jupyter notebook draws on previous notebooks I've developed, notebooks provided during the webinar sessions hosted by SPE."
